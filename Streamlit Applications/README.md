These cheat sheets are available in English, Français, and Deutsch, ensuring accessibility for a diverse audience. The application comprises over 15,000 lines of code, featuring custom functions meticulously designed to elucidate the visual output of the code snippets. Additionally, a robust documentation framework has been established to provide users with clear insights and guidance throughout their interaction with the application.
